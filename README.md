# Star Wars Express

## Purpose
This was an end of the chapter project for in which I used express to create a server side app thatallows a user to create new objects using post requests. This was mostly a walkthrough with our proffessor but I wanted to make sure I took the time to follow along with each step and inderstadn the process. 

## Process
This assignment was basically just a way to learn how to make git and post request using express.js. This was the area in the class that I really felt I needed improvement. Its nice having the extra time to be able to learn at an easier pace. It is however muh more understandable the second time around.
